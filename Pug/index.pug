					h3 What is SoftDoggy?
					| SoftDoggy is a name I have made to house all of my personal coding projects under. While it is not an official company yet, I make chose to make it an official company in the future. Until then feel free to enjoy the mostly unfinshed open source projects listed in the projects page. This page is also servering as a portoflio page for me presently too.
				div
					h3 Who am I?
					| My name is Christopher Jackson. While I plan on eventually trying to become a learning machine developer, am a student for now. I hope to use this website to help me in my transistion from being a student to working in the feild.
				div
					h3 Are you an employer looking to hire me?
					| I have many details about my qualifications on my about page. There I have a list of webstandards that I meet and the specific projects that show I meet them. I also have links to some websites I have made at school school. While, all the projects on the projects page are unfinnshed they do show a lot of my skill in a few areas, include Python, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, Babylon.js, and more. However, I if you want to see completed projects, all of the school projects are completed and listed in the about page. non-characteristic words etc.
